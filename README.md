# MyIdentityServer3Samples
### My IdentityServer3 samples with a secure sample api and 3 MVC clients for ImplicitFlow, AuthorizationCode flow, Resource owner flow 

This is just some basic sample implementations I made when studying IdentityServer3 implementation and flows to have as starting points when I need to implement IdentityServer3. User,Scopes,Clients and api are inMemory so no need for database.
